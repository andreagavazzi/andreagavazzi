### Happy to see you here! &nbsp;
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=https://github.com/andreagavazzi)

I’m Andrea Gavazzi — a passionate technologist, maker, and roboticist. My fascination with robotics sparked early and has since evolved into a lifelong pursuit of innovation through code, electronics, and intelligent systems.

In 2016, I created agRobotics — a personal brand born from the desire to blend creativity and engineering into meaningful, hands-on projects. It’s where ideas take shape: from humanoid robots to experimental AI companions that navigate, interact, and sometimes even surprise.

To me, code is more than logic — it’s a language for building behavior and breathing life into machines. Whether I’m wiring sensors, optimizing algorithms, or testing new designs, I find joy in the precision, curiosity, and play that robotics inspires.

Welcome to my world of tinkering and discovery — where the boundaries between hobby and invention blur, and each project is a step toward something unexpected.
