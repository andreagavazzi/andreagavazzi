### Happy to see you here! &nbsp;
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=https://github.com/andreagavazzi)

I’m **Andrea Gavazzi** — technologist, maker, and roboticist.  
My fascination with robots turned into a long‑term habit of building things: code, electronics and intelligent systems that move, sense and react.

In 2016 I created **agRobotics**, a personal brand for my side projects in robotics and AI.  
It’s where I experiment with humanoid platforms (like my Rakuda | Echo project), perception pipelines, and all the glue code that makes robots a bit more useful — and occasionally a bit weird.


### What I do

- 💼 Currently working at [CLAAS](https://www.claas.it) as **Solution Owner for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations**  
- 🤖 Designing and building humanoid‑style research robots under the **agRobotics** umbrella  
- 🧠 Playing with **ROS 2, GPU acceleration, depth cameras, LLMs and local AI stacks**  
- 🛠️ Enjoying the mix of **mechanics, embedded systems, and high‑level software**



### A bit more about me

- In 2016 I created [agRobotics] as a branding for my side projects in robotic science  
- Over the years, agRobotics has collaborated with **The Corpora**, **Aldebaran Robotics** and **Nyrio**  
- I genuinely like writing **clear technical documentation** (yes, really)  
- I love **kayaking at sunset**, when the lake turns into a mirror for the last light of the day

### GitHub & projects

Here on GitHub you’ll mostly find:

- ROS 2 packages and experiments for my **Rakuda | Echo** humanoid platform  
- Small utilities and prototypes for **robot perception, control, and simulation**  
- Occasional tooling around **Dynamics 365 / data / automation**
