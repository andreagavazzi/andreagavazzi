### Happy to see you here! &nbsp;
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=https://github.com/andreagavazzi)

I’m Andrea Gavazzi – a passionate technologist, maker, and roboticist.
My journey into the world of technology started with a deep fascination for robotics, which quickly evolved into a lifelong pursuit of innovation through code, electronics, and intelligent systems.

In 2016, I founded agRobotics, a brand born from the desire to merge creativity and engineering into meaningful, tangible results. At agRobotics, we go beyond building machines — we craft intelligent companions designed to navigate complex environments, assist in everyday tasks, and spark imagination.

To us, code is a form of poetry — each line carefully composed to bring sentience and behavior to our mechanical designs. From fine-tuning sensor arrays to optimizing control algorithms, I thrive at the intersection of precision and invention.

I invite you to join me on this journey — as we explore, create, and redefine what robots can be in an ever-evolving technological world.
